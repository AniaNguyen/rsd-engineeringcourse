#Introduction

## Purpose

In this course, you will move beyond programming, to learn how to construct reliable, readable,
efficient research software in a collaborative environment. The emphasis is on practical techniques,
tips, and technologies to effectively build and maintain complex code.
This is a intensive, practical course.

Synopsis
--------

1. Why use scripting languages? An overview of the available
   options. Python. IPython and the IPython notebook.
   Programming with lists. Data structures: arrays, dictionaries, and sets. Modules. Working with files and the OS.
2. Collaborating around code. Version control. Git. Github. Issue tracking. Code review. Branches and merging.
3. Testing. Unit testing and regression testing. Test driven design. Exceptions and assertions. Mocking.
   Automated and interactive testing. Build-and-test servers. Negative testing and defensive programming.
   Coverage. Duck typing. Logging.
4. Using libraries. Pypy. Packaging with setuptools. Software licensing and releases. Profiling and debugging.
5. List comprehensions. Iterables. Functional python. Map and reduce. Context managers and decorators.
6. Language bindings: calling C++ from Python.
7. Object-oriented python. Object oriented design. Software as engineering. Pragmatic use of diagram
   languages. Requirements engineering. Agile and Waterfall. Functional and architectural design.
8. Best practice in construction. Comments. Coding conventions. Documentation with Sphinx. Refactoring.
   IDEs. Design and development.
9. Libraries for research python (1): Matplotlib. Numpy.
10. Libraries for research python (2): Scipy. Pandas

Prerequisites
-------------

Prior knowledge of at least one programming language, including variables, control flow, and functions.

Exercises
---------

Examples and exercises for this course will be provided in Python.  
Python will be introduced during this course, but we will assume you can already
program. That means that you may find supplementary python content useful.

Setup
-----

You are required to bring your own laptop to the course as the classrooms we are
 using do not have desktop computers.
