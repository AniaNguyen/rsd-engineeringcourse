## Further Git

### Further Git

Mastering Git opens up a powerful set of tools for collaborative programming. In this session we took a more in depth look at Git, reviewing areas such as:

* key concepts in distributed and centralised version control
* workflows for solo- and team-working
* revision history
* good branching strategy
* merging, cherry-picking, tagging, and checking the log
* publishing a website.
