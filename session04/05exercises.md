###Exercises

The Greengraph example is only available as a single large [script](https://github.com/UCL/rsd-engineeringcourse/blob/master/session04/python/greengraph.py)

Your task is to transform this into a python package that can be pip installed directly from GitHub. Remember to include:

- an \__init\__.py file
- a setup.py file
- tests
- license and documentation
