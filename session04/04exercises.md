Exercises
---------

For exercises for this session, please try to apply what you've learned with
SCons or Fabric to a practical example of your own.

If you're working with C++ or Fortran, then try replacing whatever
make system you're using with SCons.

If you have a scripted research pipeline you work with, try
setting some of the steps up as SCons Builders.

If you have code you deploy to a web server or a supercomputer,
try using Fabric to automate the deployment.

If you have some python code, try setting up an egg with disttools.
