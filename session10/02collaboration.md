## Collaboration

### Collaboration

Our second session reviewed the elements of collaborative programming, looking at version control with Git, the importance of clear licensing, and approaches to managing software issues. 

Together we identified and fixed errors in a repository on GitHub.

### Fixing an error in the sample repository

We are looking for:

* The sample repository to be forked
* An error to be found and fixed
* The fix to be committed and pushed to the forked repository
* A pull request submitted to the upstream repository
