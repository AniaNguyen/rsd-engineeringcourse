## Collaboration

### Collaboration

Our second session reviewed the elements of collaborative programming, looking at areas such as: 

* version control with Git
* the importance of clear licensing
* approaches to managing software issues

### Fixing an error in the sample repository

Together we identified and fixed errors in a repository on GitHub. In this exercise, we were looking for:

* The sample repository to be forked
* An error to be found and fixed
* The fix to be committed and pushed to the forked repository
* A pull request submitted to the upstream repository
