## Collaboration

### Collaboration

Our second session reviewed the elements of collaborative programming, looking at version control with Git, the importance of clear licensing, and approaches to managing software issues. Together we identified and fixed errors in a repository on GitHub.

### Fixing an error in a repository

What we were looking for:

* Forked repository
* Found and fixed an error
* Committed the fix and pushed the change to the fork
* Submitted a pull request to the upstream repository
