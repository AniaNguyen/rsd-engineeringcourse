## Recap

### Python

Our first session looked at the basics of programming in Python, covering data types, control and flow, functions, and modules. We also set up our tools for future work, including Python, IPython Notebook, Git, and Github.

### Collaboration

Our second session reviewed the elements of collaborative programming, looking at version control with Git, the importance of clear licensing, and approaches to managing software issues. Together we identified and fixed errors in a repository on GitHub.

### Testing

Creating tests for our software saves time, improves code quality, and gives peace of mind. In the testing session, we learnt how to incorporate tests using frameworks like Nose, reviewed mocking and debugging, and discussed test-driven development. Our exercise was to apply this new knowledge to a Monte-Carlo algorithm.
