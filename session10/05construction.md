## Construction

### Construction

Construction is about we use letters and symbols to build readable, meaningful software. Our session covered: 

* conventions of layout and syntax
* how to write comments and documentation
* progressive improvement of code with refactoring
* refactoring code with classes

Our exercise put this knowledge into practice by refactoring 'Bad Boids', some intentionally-bad code that mimicked the motion of a flock of birds.
