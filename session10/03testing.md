## Testing

### Testing

Tests save time, improve code quality, and give peace of mind. In the testing session, we learnt how to incorporate tests using frameworks like Nose, reviewed mocking and debugging, and discussed test-driven development. Our exercise was to apply this new knowledge to implement and test a Monte-Carlo algorithm.

### The Monte-Carlo exercise

We are looking for:

* Tidy, well commented code with consistent syntax (e.g. [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/))
* Appropriate use of functions and/or classes
* Sensible set of tests
* Evidence of tests written alongside code in the commit history
