## Testing

### Testing

Tests save time, improve code quality, and give peace of mind. In the testing session, we learnt how to incorporate tests using frameworks like Nose, reviewed mocking and debugging, and discussed test-driven development. Our exercise was to apply this new knowledge to implement and test a Monte-Carlo algorithm.

### The Monte-Carlo exercise
