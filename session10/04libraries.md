## Libraries

### Libraries

Libraries make us powerful. In this session we demonstrated how existing libraries could help us to find and download a map from the web and measure the density of green space. Our exercise focused on packaging code to make it easy to share and reuse.

### Packaging the greengraph code

We were looking for:

* Readable code and sensible tests (always!)
* Well-structured package
    - Appropriate file structure
    - Packaging instructions in a setup.py file
    - License and documentation
