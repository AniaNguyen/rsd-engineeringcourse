## Performance computing

### Performance computing

Profiling allows us to spot and address performance issues with our code. The session on performance programming explored: 

* faster, array-wise operations using NumPy
* implications of data type on performance
* the Big O notation
* speed benefits of Cython

Returning to the Boids code for our exercise, we sought to reimplement the model with NumPy and Cython to make it run as fast as possible.

### Optimising the boids

We are looking for:

* Readable code and sensible tests (always!)
* Profiling to assess performance
* Attempts to optimise, for example with:
    - Appropriate use of data types
    - Cython and/or NumPy
    - Vectorisation of loops
    - Arraywise operations


<!--
Reminder about the importance of tests, which most people completing the exercise neglected. Also, if refactoring, keep the original functionality. Still need to plot. Still need to be able to run.
