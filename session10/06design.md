## Design

### Design

Deliberate design can help us to complete complex software projects, repeatably and reliably. We looked at: 

* design in object oriented programming
* Unified Modelling Language for communicating design
* design patterns
* processes, such as Agile, in the context of design

We applied the newly-gained knowledge to refactor our (now Good!) Boids code with elements of inheritance, polymorphism, and pattern design. The new code was then visualised in Unified Modelling Language.

### Adding an eagle to the boids

We were looking for:

<!--

* Readable code and sensible tests (always!)
* Object-oriented code
* Polymorphism and inheritance
* Unified Modelling Language
