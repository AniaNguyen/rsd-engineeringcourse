## DRY programming tricks

### DRY programming tricks

Unnecessary code is a home for unnecessary mistakes, so **d**on't **r**epeat **y**ourself. This session explored techniques for refactoring away repetitive code, and introduced the concepts of functional programming, exception handling, decorators, and operator overloading. Our exercise was to write a library to handle quantities with units, creating an opportunity to apply some of these concepts.

### Writing a library to handle units

We were looking for:

* Readable code and sensible tests (always!)
* Simple, well-structured library
* Clear system for unit definitions
* Operator overloading for handling units (\*,==,+)
