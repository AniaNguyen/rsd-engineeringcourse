## Recap

### Python

Our first session looked at the basics of programming in Python, covering data types, control and flow, functions, and modules.

### Collaboration

Our second session reviewed the elements of collaborative programming, looking at version control with Git, the importance of clear licensing, and approaches to managing software issues.

### Testing

Tests save time, improve code quality, and give peace of mind. In the testing session, we explored testing frameworks and test-driven development.

### Libraries

Libraries make us powerful. In this session we learnt how to benefit from existing libraries, and how to create and share our own code.

### Construction

Construction is about we use letters and symbols to build readable, meaningful software. Our session covered construction conventions and the process of refactoring.

### Design

Deliberate design can help us to complete complex software projects, repeatably and reliably. We looked at design patterns, modelling language, and development processes.

### DRY programming tricks

Unnecessary code is a home for unnecessary mistakes, so **d**on't **r**epeat **y**ourself. This session explored techniques for refactoring away repetitive code, and introduced the concepts behind functional programming.

### Performance programming

Profiling allows us to spot and address performance issues. This session reviewed methods that can help us to speed up our code.

### Further Git

Distributed version control is a powerful tool for collaborative programming. In this session we reviewed the key concepts of version control and highlighted some of the useful features of Git.
